# Number Systems Convertions
I'm taking a course at my university in which the professor told us about his own model of converting decimal numbers to any other system. 
He told us that if he was in our place he would implement this model in a program. So that's what I did.

## What I Learned
- I practiced in converting numbers from one system to another to check the results.
- I build something useful that I can use whenever I'm having trouble doing some convertions.
- I , first, needed to really comprehend the mathematical model in order to implement it with code.
